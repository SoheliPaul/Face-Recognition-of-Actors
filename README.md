Welcome to the Image Scraping and Face Recognition System project! This repository contains code and resources for scraping images from Pinterest and applying various face recognition algorithms to those images.

## Problem Statement

In the realm of computer vision, efficiently gathering and accurately recognizing faces from images is crucial for various applications, including security systems, personalized services, and social media analytics. The problem at hand is to develop a comprehensive system that addresses the following challenges:

### Image Collection
Scrape and collect images from online sources, such as Pinterest, to build a diverse and extensive dataset for face recognition.

### Face Recognition
Implement and evaluate multiple face recognition algorithms to determine their effectiveness in identifying and verifying individuals. This includes:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with Support Vector Machines (SVM) for dimensionality reduction and classification.
- Deep learning models such as ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3, and Xception for advanced feature extraction and recognition.

### Evaluation and Comparison
Assess the performance of each face recognition algorithm based on accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Compare the results to identify the most effective approach for the given dataset.
